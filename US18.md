# US18: Save Running Routine State

## Description
This PR implements **User Story 18: Save Running Routine State**, ensuring that if the app is closed (e.g., **unloaded or quit**), the **running routine's state is preserved** in a **paused state**. When the app restarts, the user can **resume their routine** from where they left off.

## Changes
- **Persist routine state** when the app is closed.
- When the app is reopened, the last running routine is **retrieved and paused**.
- Updates to the **database (`Room` persistence layer)** to store **ongoing routine data**.
- **Modified UI** to indicate that the resumed routine is in a paused state.
- **Implemented Espresso UI tests (`US18.java`)** to verify routine persistence.

## Issues Addressed
Closes **#98 #99 #100**.
