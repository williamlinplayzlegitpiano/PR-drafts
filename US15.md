# US15: Routine Pause

## Description
This PR implements **User Story 15: Routine Pause**, which introduces the ability to **pause and resume a running routine**. This allows users to track their actual time spent on a routine while excluding idle time.

## Changes
- Added **pause/resume functionality** for routines.
- Updated **UI (`pause_button` and `resume_button`)** to reflect the current state.
- Modified the **elapsed time calculation** to ignore time spent while paused.
- Ensured **timer resumes correctly** when the routine is restarted.
- **Implemented Espresso UI tests (`US15.java`)** to verify pause/resume behavior.

## Issues Addressed
Closes **#173 #174 #175**.

- [x] New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality)

## Testing
### [x] **Espresso UI Tests**
- Implemented **Espresso UI tests** to verify:

  - **Resuming the routine restarts the timer** without resetting elapsed time.
  - **Elapsed time remains unchanged while paused**.
  - **All tests are passing**.
