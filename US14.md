# US14: Asynchronous Timer

## Description
This PR implements **User Story 14: Asynchronous Timer**, which introduces a real-time elapsed time display for a running routine. The timer updates asynchronously to track how long the routine has been running.

## Changes
- Implemented an **asynchronous timer** that tracks total elapsed time for a routine.
- Updated the **UI (`total_time_display`)** to refresh dynamically.
- Ensured the timer only runs while the routine is active.
- Added **mock mode** for manual time advancements during testing.
- **Implemented Espresso UI tests (`US14.java`)** to verify correct time updates.

## Issues Addressed
Closes **#169 #170 #171 #179**.

## Testing
### [x] **Espresso UI Tests**
- Implemented **Espresso UI tests** to verify:

  - Timer updates **asynchronously** after a delay.
  - Mock mode allows **manual time advancement**.
  - Timer correctly transitions between real-time updates and manual advances.
- **All tests are passing.**
