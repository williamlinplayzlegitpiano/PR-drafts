# US17: 5-Second Completed Task Times

## Description
This PR implements **User Story 17: 5-Second Completed Task Times**, which ensures that **tasks completed in under a minute** display their recorded time in **5-second increments** instead of rounding to whole minutes. This provides **greater accuracy** in tracking short task durations.

## Changes
- Updated **task completion time formatting** logic:
  - If a task takes **less than 60 seconds**, the time is displayed in **5-second intervals** (e.g., `5s`, `10s`, `15s`).
  - If a task takes **more than 60 seconds**, the display remains in **minutes**.
- Modified the **UI timer display** to support **dynamic formatting** based on time duration.
- **Implemented Espresso UI tests (`US17.java`)** to verify correct time increments.

## Issues Addressed
Closes **#139 #140 #141 #142**.
