# US16: Asynchronous Task Timer

## Description
This PR implements **User Story 16: Asynchronous Task Timer**, which introduces an **elapsed time tracker** for the **current task**. This allows users to see how much time they have spent on a task **since completing the last task**.

## Changes
- Added an **asynchronous timer** that starts counting when a new task begins.
- Updated the **UI to display elapsed time** for the current task.
- Ensured that the timer **resets and starts fresh** when transitioning to a new task.
- Implemented logic to **pause/resume tracking** in sync with routine pauses.
- **Implemented Espresso UI tests (`US16.java`)** to validate the elapsed time updates in real-time.

## Issues Addressed
Closes **#134 #135 #136 #137**.

- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Other (explain below)

## Testing
### [x] **Espresso UI Tests**
- Implemented **Espresso UI tests** to verify:
  - **Elapsed time starts from 0** when a task begins.
  - **Time updates asynchronously** while the task is active.
  - **Switching tasks resets the timer**.
  - **Pausing the routine stops the timer**, and resuming continues the count.
  - **All tests are passing**.
